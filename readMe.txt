1. What knowledge do human beings have that is NOT captured by this language model and that therefore causes the model to generate nonsense. Write down at least three facts that, if the computer could somehow know them, would allow it to generate more sensible language.

I think that one very obvious fact is that the humans have common sense.  Therefore the humans would see that the words make no sense.
Second fact is that humans know feelings so they can generate txt to express feelings and if computer can do that it would generate better language.
Third fact is that humans know rules to how languege should be written so if the computer knew them it would help it make better languege.  


2. Compare the different poems. If your experience is like mine, some will be more coherent than others. Speculate about why this is true.

Running the programs i notticed that some programs made more sense than the other ones that i ran.  I think that the reason why this could 
be ture for some but not others is becasue that some poems have fewer words. So no matter how you will put them together they will still
make some kind of sense.
